# 📱 Product Browser App (Kotlin Multiplatform)

A cross-platform Product Browser application built using **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** and **Compose Multiplatform**. The application consumes product data from the DummyJSON API and demonstrates a clean, scalable architecture with shared business logic and UI for Android and iOS.

---

## 📌 Business Requirements

The application provides the following features:

- ✅ Display a list of products
- ✅ View product details
- ✅ Search products using API-based search
- ✅ Display product images
- ✅ Navigate between Product List and Product Detail screens
- ✅ Loading and Error state handling
- ✅ Unit testing for business logic

---

# ⚙️ Build & Run

## Requirements

- Android Studio (latest stable)
- Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin
- JDK 17 or above
- Android SDK
- Xcode (for iOS)

---

## Android

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle

4. Run the **androidApp** configuration.

---

## iOS

1. Open the project in Android Studio

2. Select an iOS Simulator

3. Run the iOS target

*(Requires Xcode on macOS.)*

---

# 🧪 Unit Testing

The project includes a unit test for:

- `GetProductsUseCase`

The use case is tested using a **Fake Repository** to isolate business logic from networking.

---

# 🎯 Design Decisions

- Implemented **Clean Architecture** for better separation of concerns.
- Used **StateFlow** for reactive UI state management.
- Manual Dependency Injection to keep the project lightweight.
- Repository Pattern to abstract data sources.
- Shared UI built using Compose Multiplatform.

---

# ⚖️ Trade-offs

Due to the assessment time constraints:

- Manual Dependency Injection was used instead of Koin.
- Remote API only (no local database or caching).
- Focused on functionality over animations and advanced UI polish.
- Category filtering was not implemented as it was optional.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Category Filtering
- Offline Caching
- Pagination
- Favorites
- Pull-to-Refresh
- Better Error UI
- Dark Theme Support
- Dependency Injection using Koin
- UI Testing
